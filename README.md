# Python packages

### What is a package
- A package is a set of useful functions and classes that are useful for common tasks

### Why should we use them?
- Because they make writing code orders of magnitude easier and faster.
Instead of having to write the same code again and again, or putting energy and time into creating a codebase ex-novo, it's much more convenient to import packages that have already been tested and that have been improved to the point of reaching the best computational efficiency and speed possible.

### What is pip?
- `pip` is a package managed in Python, used to install any packages
- we use `pip install package_name` to install a package in Python2, `pip3 install package_name` in Python3
